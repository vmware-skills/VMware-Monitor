"""Text I/O must declare its codec, or it decodes with the machine's locale.

Real-hardware finding, 2026-08-30. On a Windows Server 2025 host with locale
cp936 (GBK), reading a UTF-8 file with no ``encoding=`` uses the locale codec.
In vmware-policy that broke the rules file and the policy engine **failed
open**: a ``freeze-production-writes`` rule that should DENY came back ALLOW. In
vmware-harden it killed the baselines while the doctor still reported them
loaded.

This family ships a 等保 2.0 baseline and Chinese documentation, so its users
are exactly the people on non-UTF-8 Windows — the population least likely to be
represented on the UTF-8 CI runner where every one of these files is green.

Mechanical rather than remembered (形态 #6): a new undeclared read fails here.

Known blind spot, stated rather than left implicit: ``Path.open()`` is not
checked. Distinguishing it from ``tarfile.open`` / ``gzip.open`` needs the
receiver's type, which a parser does not have, and flagging those would push
someone into a wrong "fix" — their ``encoding`` means member names, or nothing.
Nothing in this package opens text through ``Path.open`` today.
