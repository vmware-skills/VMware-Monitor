"""The CLI, the doctor and the MCP server must open the same config file.

Swept for after the same defect was found on real hardware in the sibling Aria
skill, 2026-08-30. This skill had it in the Storage variant, which is the worse
one: ``load_config`` resolved ``config_path or CONFIG_FILE`` and never looked at
``VMWARE_MONITOR_CONFIG`` at all, while the MCP server read the variable — once
in ``_ensure_conn_mgr``, and again through ``mtime_cached_loader`` — and passed
the result down explicitly.

Reproduced before the fix, against a real config at the default path and the
variable pointing elsewhere::

    load_config()  -> targets: ['home-esxi', 'home-vcenter']   # CLI and doctor
    mtime_cached() -> targets: ['from-env']                    # MCP server

Two different vCenters in one installation, selected by which surface you came
in through. This skill is read-only, so nothing is damaged; what happens
instead is that the agent reports healthy hosts and empty alarm lists for a
vCenter the operator is not looking at, which is its own kind of harm in a
monitoring tool. And the doctor — which is what people run when something is
wrong — reported on the CLI's file, so it could green-light a configuration no
tool would open.

``VMWARE_MONITOR_CONFIG`` is this skill's advertised ``primaryEnv`` in its
OpenClaw metadata, so the CLI honouring it is the documented behaviour; ignoring
it was the bug.

The precedence now lives in exactly one function, ``resolve_config_path``, that
every reader goes through — copies of a rule do not disagree loudly, they
disagree slowly, which is how this one drifted (CLAUDE.md 形态 #6).
