"""Regression: the MCP instructions name the configured targets — in every branch.

``initialize`` hands the client the server's ``instructions``, and for a skill
whose every tool takes ``target`` that string is the only place the client learns
which targets exist. While it was static, the model called tools with no target,
got whatever the default happened to be, and answered confidently about the wrong
system: on 2026-09-15 this skill's default was a standalone ESXi host, so "how
many VMs does the vCenter have" was answered from that host, and an estate with a
vCenter was told it had none.

The listing was added then. What this file pins is the part that was still
missing on 2026-09-20: **the branch where the config cannot be read**. It
returned the base text with no listing at all — and a client shown no listing
cannot tell "this skill has no targets worth naming" from "this skill could not
read them". The first reading is the one that produces a confident answer about a
system nobody chose, and it is the state every customer is in on day one, before
they run ``init``. Silence is not an answer.
